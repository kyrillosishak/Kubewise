# On-Premises Pricing Configuration
# Calculate your own costs based on hardware and operational expenses

# Method 1: Simple calculation based on hardware costs
# Formula: (Hardware Cost + Power + Cooling + Space) / (Useful Life * Total Resources)

costEstimation:
  provider: custom
  customPricing:
    # Example calculation:
    # Server cost: $10,000 for 32 cores, 128GB RAM
    # 3-year useful life = 26,280 hours
    # Power/cooling/space: ~30% overhead
    # 
    # CPU: ($10,000 * 0.6 * 1.3) / (26,280 * 32) = ~$0.009/core-hour
    # Memory: ($10,000 * 0.4 * 1.3) / (26,280 * 128) = ~$0.0015/GB-hour
    
    cpuPerCoreHour: "0.009"
    memoryPerGBHour: "0.0015"

---
# Method 2: Based on internal chargeback rates
# Use your organization's internal IT chargeback rates

costEstimation:
  provider: custom
  customPricing:
    # Example: IT department charges $0.02/core-hour and $0.003/GB-hour
    cpuPerCoreHour: "0.02"
    memoryPerGBHour: "0.003"

---
# Method 3: Opportunity cost (cloud equivalent)
# Price based on what it would cost to run in cloud

costEstimation:
  provider: custom
  customPricing:
    # Use cloud pricing as a baseline for comparison
    # This helps justify on-prem vs cloud decisions
    cpuPerCoreHour: "0.04"
    memoryPerGBHour: "0.005"

---
# Method 4: Zero cost (resource optimization only)
# Use when you only care about resource efficiency, not cost

costEstimation:
  provider: custom
  customPricing:
    # Set to minimal values to focus on resource optimization
    # Savings will show resource reduction, not dollar amounts
    cpuPerCoreHour: "0.001"
    memoryPerGBHour: "0.0001"
